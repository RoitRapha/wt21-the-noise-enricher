# wt21-the-noise-enricher

The projectâ€™s aim is to provide musicians a way of transforming their own music with novel sound structures using Artificial Intelligence. The musicians can privately upload their music ideas, define the style of transformation, and receive a modified sound sample. This unique transformation can be implemented in their music and may also bring new ideas, perspectives, and textures.
